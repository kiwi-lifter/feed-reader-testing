# Feed Reader - Testing with Jasmine

Project for Udacity FEND nano degree - using Jasmine to test a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. 

**Scenario:** The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

##Getting Started##

**1.** Clone the repo `https://github.com/kiwi-lifter/feed-reader-testing.git`.

**2.** Open the index.html in a webrowser.
